# svim
svim stands for simplified vim. The core goal was to create a commandline text editor that makes it easier to get started than other CLI editors, without sacrificing too much editing power. As the name implies, svim draws heavy inspiration from the vi editor and the vim command grammar.

This readme is written for version 0.5.2.

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

svims aims to lower the skill floor for users new to the world of cli editors, while keeping the skill ceiling high for those who know what they are doing. A minimal amount of shortcuts is needed to get started, and the command grammar is designed to be consistent, intuitive and easy to master. Additionally, multiple planned features will encourage discovering commands to add to your toolbox, rather than having a memorization overhead.

## ARCHITECTURE

The under-the-hood architecture is built around a Model-View-Controller architecture, with a state pattern for modal editing and mode-specific shortcuts. User Actions are processed using a command pattern, allowing for a low-cost undo/redo history via delta tracking.

## KEY FEATURES

svim displays useful meta information about the file currently being edited:
- the current mode
- The file currently being edited
- the save state of the file
- the cursor position
- the number of words, paragraphs and characters
- the current version of the editor
- paragraph numbers along the left edge

There are also several quality-of-life features to make using svim as smooth as possible. The text history system groups text into words when undoing them to make deleting larger sections of text or undoing large deletions faster. Additionally files are periodically backed up to a fixed location relative to the location of the executable. That way, you never lose more than five minuts of progress.

## GETTING STARTED

### MINIMUM REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE

To get started with svim, you will need to understand the two core modes: TYPING MODE is used for writing and deleting text, whereas TOOL MODE is used for all of svims commands. When in TOOL MODE, press 'i' to enter TYPING MODE. When in TYPING MODE, press the escape key to enter TOOL MODE. Move the cursor with the arrow keys in either mode or, if you are in TOOL MODE, using h (left), j (down), k (up) and l (right). When in TOOL MODE, you can save with !s and quit with !q.

### EXISTING COMMANDS
Unless otherwise specified, all commands stay in TOOL MODE.

The following commands require only a single input:

- e & E: the ERASE operator. Erases the character under the cursor. E (uppercase) enters TYPING MODE, e (lowercase) stays in TOOL MODE
- u & U: the UNDO & REDO operator. u (lowercase) undoes the most recent editing action, U (uppercase) redoes the most recently undone action.
- o & O: the paragraph creation operator. o (lowercase) creates a paragraph below the current one, O (uppercase) creates a paragraph above the current one
- + & -: the Split & Join operators. + (plus) joins the next paragraph to the current one, - (minus) splits the current paragraph from the cursor onwards into its own paragraph
- \> & <: the INDENTATION operator. > (greater than) indents the current paragraph to the next multiple of four spaces, < (less than) unindents the current paragraph to the previous multiple of four spaces. TAB and SHIFT-TAB do the same thing, both in TYPING MODE and in TOOL MODE. Currently, tab width is locked to four spaces, but it will be possible to configure this in a future update.

The next section describes 'compound commands', which are commands where a secondary input is needed. There are three types of input: Scopes, ranges and arguments.

Scopes divide the text to specify what text area will be affected by commands. At any point, the cursor is in all five scopes at once - think of them as subsets of each other.
- w = word: one or more letters and numbers, seperated by whitespace or special characters. (or the end of a paragraph)
- e = expression: one or more letters, numbers and special characters, seperated by whitespace (or the end of a paragraph)
- l = line: a visual line on the screen (depends on window width)
- p = paragraph: one paragraph of text
- f = file: the entire file

Ranges are sections of text surrounded by a matching pair of delimiting characters:
- " = within double quotes
- ' = within single quotes
- ( = within parentheses
- { = within curly braces
- [ = within brackets
- < = within angled brackets
Ranges account for nesting, meaning in a string like '(abc(def)ghi)', with the cursor on 'a', 'm(' (move to the end of the parentheses) would move to i, not f, because 'def' is within nested parentheses.

Arguments are a general-purpose type of input that will be processed individually by each operator.

MOVE operator (m & M): Accepts either a scope or a range. m (lowercase) moves the cursor forward to the end of the given scope or range. M (uppercase) moves the cursor backward to the start of the given scope or range.

NEXT operator (n & N): Accepts either a scope or a range. n (lowercase) moves the cursor to the start of the next scope or range. N (uppercase) moves the cursor backwards to the end of the previous scope or range.

FIND operator (f & F): Accepts an argument. f (lowercase) moves the cursor to the next occurrence of that argument. F (uppercase) moves the cursor backwards to the previous occurrence of that argument. As opposed to vim, this is not limited to the current paragraph.

AT operator (a & A): Accepts either a scope or a range. Moves the cursor just like the move operator, but also enters TYPING MODE.

NOTE: In case the target position is not reachable (e.g. f; without a semicolon to find, nf,...), all movement operations described above move as far as possible.

REPLACE operator (r): Accepts an argument. The character under the cursor is replaced by the argument.

TOGGLE CASE operator (t & T): Accepts either a scope or a range. t (lowercase) sets that scope or range to lowercase, T (uppercase) sets the scope or range to uppercase.

SYSTEM operator (!): Accepts one of the following arguments:
- q: if all changes are saved, quit. Otherwise display a warning.
- Q: save all changes and quit.
- x: quit without saving
- s: save

DELETE operators (d & D): d (lowercase) accepts a scope or range. That area is deleted. D (uppercase) accepts an argument. The area from the cursor to the next occurence of the argument is deleted (including the argument and the starting position).

CHANGE operators (c & C): c and C work just like d and D, but switches to TYPING MODE.

YANK operators (y & Y): y (lowercase) accepts a scope or range. That area is copied to an internal clipboard. Y (uppercase) accepts an argument. The area from the cursor to the next occurence of the argument is copied to an internal clipboard (including the argument and the starting position).

PASTE operator (p & P): p (lowercase) pastes the contents of the internal clipboard after the cursor, P (uppercase) pastess the contents of the internal clipboard before the cursor.

REPEAT operator (.): Repeats the last editing command (specifics to be determined)

### UPCOMING OPERATORS

HELP operator (?): Accepts an argument. If that argument is an operator, usage tips for that operator are displayed as a temporary message. If that argument is also a scope or range indicator, that scope or range is explained as well.

SYSTEM operator (!): In addition to the already existing options, these will be added:
- r: rename the file
- c: configure settings

## Technical Stack

Svim is written in C++ 20 using the ncurses library for rendering and input handeling. Everything else was built from scratch or uses the C++ standard library.

## ROADMAP & LIMITATIONS
What can it do, what can't it do, what will it be able to do soon

In addition to the planned commands described above, the following features are planned:
1. Changing settings at runtime (e.g. disabling UI color, relative vs absolute vs no line numbering, What meta information to display).
2. Simple spell checking / typo detection
3. Selection mode similar to vim's visual mode

Some additional features are being considered, but are not guaranteed to be implemented
1. vim-like macros
2. Rendering bold / italics / headings in markdown files
3. syntax highlighting in code files using an LSP
4. find and search replace commands
5. hotloading if the file is changed by an external source while opened in svim
6. switching between multiple opened files
7. auto-inserting bullet points / numberings of numbered lists
8. prefixing some commands with a number to repeat them 

Limitations svim has and will have for at least the near future:
- no unicode support (ascii only)
- no interaction with system clipboard
